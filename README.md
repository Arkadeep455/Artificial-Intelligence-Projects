# Artificial-Intelligence-Projects
This is where Iâ€™ve gathered all my implementations for machine learning in Python.

**LlamaIndex-implementations:** 
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation):** Enhanced LLM responses with real-time, accurate external information.
- **AI Agents:** Automated data tasks and develop advanced apps using LlamaIndex agents.
- **Query and Chat Engines:** Created stateful systems that maintain context for more engaging conversations.
- **Streamlit Interfaces:** Transformed Python scripts into interactive web apps with minimal code.


**Langchain-implemetations:**
- **Prompting Techniques:** Utilized few-shot prompting, Chain of Thought, and ReAct prompting to guide model responses.
- **Chat & Open Source Models:** Explored conversational agents and community-driven model alternatives.
- **Prompt Engineering:** Involves crafting effective Prompts, using PromptTemplates (e.g., langchainub), and output parsers like Pydantic.
- **Chaining Operations:** Leveraged chains (e.g., create_retrieval_chain, create_stuff_documents_chain) to sequentially process tasks.
- **Agents & Customization:** Developed various agents (custom, Python, CSV, Agent Routers) for specialized data tasks.
- **Tool Integration:** Employed OpenAI Functions and tool calling within broader toolkits.
- **Memory & Vectorstores:** Integrated memory modules and vector stores (Pinecone, FAISS) for context management and data retrieval.
- **RAG (Retrieval Augmentation Generation):** Merged real-time external knowledge with LLM responses.
- **Document Handling:** Used DocumentLoaders and TextSplitters to process and manage text data.
- **UI Development:** Applied Streamlit for quick creation of interactive web interfaces.
