This is where Iâ€™ve gathered all my implementations for machine learning in Python.

LlamaIndex: 
Core Concepts:

Custom ChatGPT Training: Dive deep into the intricacies of training ChatGPT on custom data sets, empowering you to create language models tailored to specific industry needs.

RAG (retrieval-augmented generation): the cutting-edge AI framework! Imagine pulling the latest and greatest facts directly from external knowledge bases, all to supercharge your Large Language Models (LLMs)! Not only does RAG ensure that your LLM is operating on the most up-to-date, accurate information, but it also gives you a thrilling behind-the-scenes look at how these language models generate their responses.

AI agents: Create smart AI data agents with LlamaIndex agents. Automate data tasks with LlamaIndex, optimize workflows, and create astonishing AI LLM applications. AI agents are the apps of the future.

Query and Chat Engines: Get hands-on experience in building stateful query and chat engines. Learn how to maintain context in your conversations, offering a more enriched user experience.

Streamlit Interfaces: Elevate your project by learning how to create intuitive and interactive interfaces using Streamlit. Turn your data scripts into fully functional web apps with just a few lines of Python.
